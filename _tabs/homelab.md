This is an overview of my current homelab setup. Having a homelab allows me to learn about new technologies and practice building my skillset. One of my goals this year is to take my homelab to the next level and I'm currently working on implementing new technologies and hardware. I will update this page as I continue to make changes and add new things to my homelab.

## VirtualBox
I currently use VirtualBox for all of my virtual machine needs. This lets me experiment with running different operating systems and learn about new technologies in a sandboxed environment. As of right now, my VirtualBox environment consists of several Linux VMs, as well as an Active Directory environment made up of a Windows Server 2019 domain controller and 2 Windows 10 client machines.

Virtual Machines:
* Windows Server 2019
* Windows 10 x 2
* Ubuntu 24.04
* Linux Mint 22
* Kali Linux

## Raspberry Pi 5
I have a Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB of RAM. So far, it has been a great hands-on tool for learning and has allowed me to experiment with running various technologies and services. You can learn more about how I built it in my blog post titled "[CanaKit Raspberry Pi 5 Starter Kit PRO]({% link _posts/2025-03-16-canakit-raspberry-pi-5-starter-kit-pro.md %})".
