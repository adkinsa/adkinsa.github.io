Hi, I'm Aaron, and I'm passionate about IT. Ever since I was young, I've had a love for computers and technology. After taking several tech-related courses in college, my passion for IT grew even stronger, and that's when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in IT. Although my work experience so far has been in retail and other industries, I'm actively seeking an opportunity to begin my career in IT and am eager to continue learning and growing.

I created this website to share my technical projects and homelab, and to blog about various tech-related topics. If you would like to contact me, you can send me an email using the mail icon at the bottom of the navigation sidebar. Other than that, feel free to have a look around or check out one of my blog posts.

Thanks for visiting!
