In this post, I'm going to talk about my journey and experience with TryHackMe. If you're not familiar with TryHackMe, it's an online learning platform for Cybersecurity training. They offer a hands-on learning experience with various learning paths to choose from, which you can learn more about on their website [here](https://tryhackme.com/){:target="_blank"}. Since starting my journey with TryHackMe, I've found it to be an invaluable resource for learning and building my skillset, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Cybersecurity.

## My progress so far
I actually joined TryHackMe sometime last year, but it wasn't until recently that I became dedicated to spending more time on the platform. Most of my progress has been made over the past month or two, and this is a screenshot of my profile banner as of today, 4/24/2025:

As you can see, I have completed a total of 35 rooms and earned 7 badges. My most recent accomplishment is earning the 30-day streak badge, which means I logged into the platform for 30 consecutive days and completed at least 1 question a day.

As of today, my streak is at 33 days, and I plan on continuing it for as long as I can, with my next goal being to receive the 90-day streak badge. Working towards the streak badges has helped me stay dedicated to learning a little bit each day. When it comes to IT and Cybersecurity, there is so much to learn that at times it can become overwhelming. When I start to get overwhelmed, I try to take a step back and focus on learning a little bit each day. I also like to remind myself of all the progress I have made so far and think about where I am now compared to a year ago.

Here are some of the other badges I have earned so far:

Some of my favorite rooms I have completed so far include the **Nmap**, **Networking Concepts**, and **Network Services** rooms. The Nmap room was an introduction to using the Nmap tool, and the Networking Concepts room was an introduction to the OSI model and TCP/IP protocol suite. I also enjoyed the Network Services room, which covered the network services SMB, Telnet, and FTP, as well as how to enumerate and exploit them.

One of the main aspects of TryHackMe that has benefited me most is the hands-on learning experience. For example, in the Nmap room, you first learn about Nmap and then have the chance to practice using it with the virtual machine lab. This helps you gain a better understanding of something through hands-on experience, as opposed to just reading about it or watching a video. This hands-on approach has also helped me practice strengthening some of my skills, such as my knowledge of basic Linux commands and navigating the Linux terminal.

## The future with TryHackMe
My plan is to continue building my skills with TryHackMe and to try to maintain my streak for as long as I can. My next goal is also to earn the 90-day streak badge. So far, I've been using the free membership, and there has been plenty to do. There are some limitations to the free membership, such as the rooms you can access, so I may look into upgrading to a premium membership in the near future. However, for now, I'm just going to keep grinding and learn as much as I can from the material available to me.

## Conclusion
Overall, TryHackMe has been a great resource for learning and building my cyber security skills, and I recommend it to anyone interested in learning about Cybersecurity. The hands-on approach to learning has been beneficial in helping me continue building my skillset, and the best part is that it's free. I'm happy with the progress I've made so far, and I'll provide future updates on my learning journey with TryHackMe.
