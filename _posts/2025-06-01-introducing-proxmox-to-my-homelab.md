This post provides a quick overview of the steps I took to install and set up Proxmox in my homelab. I chose Proxmox over alternative hypervisors because it's open source and is widely recommended in the homelab community. There is also a large community to turn to for support, including resources such as the official [Proxmox community forum](https://forum.proxmox.com/){: target="_blank"} and the subreddit [r/Proxmox](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/){: target="_blank"}.

## Hardware
The hardware I'm using to run Proxmox is a Beelink Mini S13 Mini PC with an Intel N150 3.6 GHz processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 500GB M.2 SSD.

## Installing and setting up Proxmox
In this section, I'm going to go over the steps I took to install and set up Proxmox.

### Step 1: Download Proxmox ISO
The first step I took was to download the Proxmox VE 8.4 ISO from [proxmox.com/en/downloads](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads){: target="_blank"}.

### Step 2: Create a bootable flash drive with Proxmox ISO
To create a bootable flash drive, I used Rufus, which can be downloaded from [rufus.ie/en/](https://rufus.ie/en/){: target="_blank"}.

### Step 3: Boot from the Proxmox flash drive
Next, I plugged the flash drive into the Beelink Mini S13 Mini PC and booted from it.

### Step 4: Install Proxmox
At the Proxmox installer welcome screen, I chose the option "**Install Proxmox VE (Graphical)**" and then proceeded with the installation. During the installation process, I assigned the server a static IP address after verifying the DHCP scope of my router to ensure there were no IP address conflicts.

### Step 5: Access the Proxmox Server Web UI
After the installation was complete, I accessed the Proxmox Server Web UI by opening a web browser and navigating to the server's IP address, followed by port number 8006. I then logged in using the credentials I had set during the installation process and was greeted by the Proxmox dashboard.

### Step 6: Create a virtual machine
The last thing I did was create an Ubuntu Desktop VM. To do this, I first downloaded the Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS ISO image from [ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop){: target="_blank"} and then followed a tutorial on creating a VM in Proxmox.

That's all for now.

Next up, I plan to work on adding more virtual machines and containers. So, stay tuned for future updates on some of the changes I've made.
